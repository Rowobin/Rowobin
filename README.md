# Hi there, I'm Rowobin!

I'm a 20-year-old Junior Developer/Student from/currently living Portugal.

I'm really into computer graphics. You can usually find me working on a side project (or multiple).

I made a 3D portfolio that I think is pretty cool, [check it out](https://rowobin.github.io/3D-Room-Portfolio/).
